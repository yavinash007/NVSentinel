# Usage:
#   - GitHub Actions: Read and parse this file in versions.yaml
#   - Makefiles: Source versions using yq or similar YAML parser
#   - Documentation: Reference this file for version requirements
#
# When updating versions:
#   1. Update the version here
#   2. Test locally with: make install-lint-tools, make install-go-ci
#   3. Verify CI/CD workflows still pass
